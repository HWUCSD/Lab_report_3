     13 The main funding source for Maryland's legal services to the
     14 poor has fallen on hard times, and advocates are preparing to seek
     15 unprecedented state financial help - even as they keep an eye on a
     16 legal challenge that threatens to cut off a main source of funding
     17 for such services nationwide.
     18 The Maryland Legal Services Corp. - which supports 28
     19 organizations providing legal help to those with cases involving
     20 domestic abuse, landlord-tenant disputes and other issues - faces a
     21 $1 million budget shortfall because of slack interest on the
     22 accounts that help fund it.
     23 The state's chief judge is seeking a $1.2 million subsidy to
     24 close the gap in the organization's $7 million annual budget, and
     25 advocates are planning a strong push in the General Assembly.
     26 "You can bet we will be doing every kind of lobbying we can do
     27 for our funding," said Wilhelm H. Joseph Jr., executive director of
     28 the Maryland Legal Aid Bureau, the largest provider of legal help

      6 Indiana: Commission looks to fill gaps

     10 Funding cuts in free legal aid for 2003 could mean less access
     11 to courts for the poor, but the District 9 Pro Bono Commission is
     12 hoping to fill the gap.
     13 Indiana Legal Services, the primary provider of free legal aid
     14 in the state, is facing a $1.05 million cut in its 2003 budget,
     15 said Courtney Mathews, a paralegal and local intake coordinator for
     16 Indiana Legal Services.
     17 A drop in population revealed by the 2000 census is responsible
     18 for some of the funding cut, Mathews said. The agency also is in
     19 danger of losing $470,000 over the next 18 months from the Violence
     20 Against Women Act, but is appealing that decision, Mathews
     21 said.
     22 The cuts have meant staff reductions in Indiana Legal Services'
     23 Indianapolis office, eliminating one attorney, two paralegals and
     24 one administrator, Mathews said. The agency has only about a half
     25 dozen attorneys for 18 counties, Mathews said.
     26 The other source of free legal aid in Indiana is through
     27 district pro bono commissions established by the chief justice of
     28 the Indiana Supreme Court. Under that program, civil cases for
     29 eligible clients are assigned to private attorneys who have agreed
     30 to participate. Union Circuit Judge James Williams, who oversees

The district "should have sent notices to renters in addition to

Tulare County Water Works may also come under Schneider's

"Professor Zucker is a huge advocate for the little man," said
Nicole Blackman, 21, a senior business major at Cal State
Northridge. "He is one of those people who wants to see good things
happen to good people."
The toughest challenge in defending the poor is focusing on a
case's merits and not on a client's circumstances, Zucker said.
"I am a lawyer, and my job is to protect the interests of my
client, but some cases don't have merit and I have to let them go,"
he said. "I don't take every case, but I take the clients
seriously."
On a recent morning at the Legal Access Center, Zucker sat at a
small table with Jacqueline Green, 41, of North Hollywood. The
single mother was trying to avoid being evicted.
"He is treating me like gold," Green said. "He is a kind,
nice-hearted man. He doesn't care if you are on public assistance:
He's willing to help."
Although he is doing what he loves most, Zucker said, at times,
he gets worn down by his clients' overwhelming poverty. To relieve
the burden, he frequently goes for long drives or talks shop with
his wife, Kiren Dosanjh, also an attorney and Cal State Northridge
professor.
Looking back, Zucker said he doesn't regret his decision to
dedicate his career to defending the poor.
"Someone once said, 'Get a job you love, and you'll never work a
day in your life,' " Zucker said. "I believe it's more important to
get a job you are happy with and let things flow from there."

Working for Free Pays Off for Caring Lawyer
Bruce Zucker chooses to provide pro bono legal aid to poor
tenants over more prestigious work, and it has become his life's
passion.

Karima A. Haynes
Sunday, January 5, 2003
Nothing in Bruce Zucker's upbringing seems to have prepared him
for his life's work defending the poor.
A tall, athletic man who favors pleated khakis and starched
button-down shirts, Zucker grew up in an upper-middle-class enclave
in the west San Fernando Valley, far from the poverty he now sees
every day.
At Taft High School and UCLA, Zucker said, the closest brush
with poverty was reading newspaper articles about unscrupulous
bosses withholding wages from garment district workers.
Before graduating from Loyola Law School in 1993, Zucker
interviewed with a prestigious Santa Monica law firm and deftly
matched wits with the partners over lunch at an upscale restaurant.
Yet as he chatted amiably with the partners, something wasn't quite
right.
"I just didn't get the impression that they were really happy,"
Zucker said. "They seemed to be more passionate about their weekend
plans than the work they were doing."
After the meeting, Zucker realized he had to ask himself some
fundamental questions. What was his life's passion? What work would

Justice_for_all.txt:6:Documentary shows how Legal Services aids people who have
Justice_for_all.txt:7:nowhere else to turn

Justice_for_all.txt:9:By Rudy Larini
Justice_for_all.txt:10:Thursday, January 23, 2003
Justice_for_all.txt:11:After becoming disabled in a machete attack on a visit to his
Justice_for_all.txt:12:native Haiti, Jean-Claude Joseph needed help persuading his
Justice_for_all.txt:13:landlord to move him from a fifth-floor apartment to one on the
Justice_for_all.txt:14:ground floor.
Justice_for_all.txt:15:Isaac Benjamin became ensnared in a bureaucratic snafu that took
Justice_for_all.txt:16:away his Social Security disability payments for more than two
Justice_for_all.txt:17:years.
Justice_for_all.txt:18:The story of Martha, a woman from Sierra Leone, was more
Justice_for_all.txt:19:compelling. Beaten, raped and tortured in her politically
Justice_for_all.txt:20:repressive homeland, she knowingly used someone else's passport to
Justice_for_all.txt:21:escape to America, but was caught by immigration authorities upon
Justice_for_all.txt:22:her arrival. She desperately sought political asylum.
Justice_for_all.txt:23:Not the kind of cases that lead to ground-breaking upheavals in
Justice_for_all.txt:24:the law, but the kind of cases that are handled day in and day out
Justice_for_all.txt:25:by lawyers for the legally disenfranchised who have no where else
Justice_for_all.txt:26:to turn.
Justice_for_all.txt:27:The work of attorneys from Legal Services of New Jersey will be
Justice_for_all.txt:28:highlighted in a onehour documentary, "Quest for Justice," to be
Justice_for_all.txt:29:aired 9 p.m. today on New Jersey Network. Produced by NYD2, a
Justice_for_all.txt:30:communications firm based in Somerset, the documentary features
Justice_for_all.txt:31:case histories of clients whose needs ranged from housing to
Justice_for_all.txt:32:fighting off deportation.
Justice_for_all.txt:33:Joseph, a 54-year-old naturalized citizen, turned to Legal
Justice_for_all.txt:34:Services when the landlord of his federally subsidized apartment
Justice_for_all.txt:35:complex in Elizabeth turned a deaf ear to his request for a
Justice_for_all.txt:36:ground-floor apartment.
Justice_for_all.txt:37:Having lost the use of his left arm in warding off the machete
Justice_for_all.txt:38:attack during a robbery attempt, Joseph said he found it
Justice_for_all.txt:39:increasingly difficult to negotiate the five flights of stairs
Justice_for_all.txt:40:lugging groceries or laundry on the frequent occasions when the
Justice_for_all.txt:41:building's elevator was out of order.
Justice_for_all.txt:42:"With this, it became impossible for me to stay upstairs," he
Justice_for_all.txt:43:said, pointing to the scars on his forearm. "If I cannot carry my
Justice_for_all.txt:44:groceries or my laundry, how can I live?"
Justice_for_all.txt:45:"It was a compelling case," said Legal Services attorney Stephen
Justice_for_all.txt:46:St. Hilaire. "The key for us -- and we have to make tough decisions
Justice_for_all.txt:47:all the time on whether to take a case -- was visualizing what he
Justice_for_all.txt:48:had to do to get to the fifth floor, struggling with a bag of
Justice_for_all.txt:49:groceries," he said.
Justice_for_all.txt:50:Benjamin, 53, of Jersey City had been collecting Social Security
Justice_for_all.txt:51:disability after undergoing double bypass surgery when the checks
Justice_for_all.txt:52:stopped coming. He said the agency claimed he had failed to return
Justice_for_all.txt:53:a form updating the condition of his health.
Justice_for_all.txt:54:"But what got me was they didn't let me know they didn't get it,
Justice_for_all.txt:55:they just cut me off," he said, adding he found it impossible to
Justice_for_all.txt:56:negotiate the Social Security bureaucracy himself.
Justice_for_all.txt:57:"When I would call them up or go up there, they would give me
Justice_for_all.txt:58:blank stares," he said. "I didn't know what to do."
Justice_for_all.txt:59:So he contacted Legal Services and his case was assigned to
Justice_for_all.txt:60:paralegal David Morris.
Justice_for_all.txt:61:"Isaac's case was one of government screw-ups," Morris said,
Justice_for_all.txt:62:recounting how Social Security shuffled his file from New Jersey to
Justice_for_all.txt:63:Baltimore and then Philadelphia before finally tracking it down.
Justice_for_all.txt:64:Legal Services eventually got Benjamin's benefits restored.
Justice_for_all.txt:65:Martha, who does not want her last name used, believes she owes
Justice_for_all.txt:66:her very life to Legal Services and lawyer Laura Adjangba, who won
Justice_for_all.txt:67:her political asylum in the United States.
Justice_for_all.txt:68:"This is a great thing she has done for me in this world," she
Justice_for_all.txt:69:said as tears welled up in her eyes. "God just brought her to take
Justice_for_all.txt:70:care of my problem."
Justice_for_all.txt:71:In New Jersey, Legal Services has represented more than 1.3
Justice_for_all.txt:72:million clients since the program was conceived during President
Justice_for_all.txt:73:Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty in the mid1960s.
Justice_for_all.txt:74:In a survey last year, Legal Services determined that more than
Justice_for_all.txt:75:one-third of New Jersey's poor adults -- more than 400,000 people
Justice_for_all.txt:76:-- have at least one civil legal problem a year. There are Legal
Justice_for_all.txt:77:Services offices in every county except Salem and they handle
Justice_for_all.txt:78:roughly 50,000 cases a year.
Justice_for_all.txt:79:New Jersey has a Legal Services budget of almost $38 million and
Justice_for_all.txt:80:a staff of 500, including about 200 attorneys.
Justice_for_all.txt:81:The lawyers, many of whom could be earning considerably more in
Justice_for_all.txt:82:the private sector, are uniformly devoted to the principle of
Justice_for_all.txt:83:providing legal assistance to those who otherwise might be denied
Justice_for_all.txt:84:their day in court.
Justice_for_all.txt:85:"People often say, 'Oh, you work with Legal Services because you
Justice_for_all.txt:86:couldn't work for a big firm with 300 people,'" attorney Grayce
Justice_for_all.txt:87:Wiggins explains on the documentary. "People that work at Legal
Justice_for_all.txt:88:Services are committed to the mission of legal services. This is
Justice_for_all.txt:89:more than just a job. This is about changing people's lives."
Justice_for_all.txt:90:"With this group, you hear them regularly say to a person they
Justice_for_all.txt:91:are honored to practice this kind of law," said Michael DeFabrizio,
Justice_for_all.txt:92:an NYD2 vice president and the executive producer of the
Justice_for_all.txt:93:documentary.
Justice_for_all.txt:94:In the opening segment of the documentary, Nicholas deB.
Justice_for_all.txt:95:Katzenbach, who was U.S. attorney general under Johnson, scoffs at
Justice_for_all.txt:96:the notion that Legal Services is just another government
Justice_for_all.txt:97:handout.
Justice_for_all.txt:98:"I think many people think of Legal Services as something
Justice_for_all.txt:99:charitable," he said. "The purpose of Legal Services is not to give
Justice_for_all.txt:100:something to the poor other than the justice that every person is
Justice_for_all.txt:101:entitled to."
Justice_for_all.txt:102:Does DeFabrizio believe his documentary will help convince
Justice_for_all.txt:103:people of the need for the kind of help offered by Legal
Justice_for_all.txt:104:Services?
Justice_for_all.txt:105:"You hope that the public cares," he said. "Civilization really
Justice_for_all.txt:106:depends on human beings caring about other human beings."

Valley_Needing_Legal_Services.txt:6:McALLEN (AP) - The consolidation of legal services agencies for
Valley_Needing_Legal_Services.txt:7:the poor may improve efficiency, but won't increase the number of
Valley_Needing_Legal_Services.txt:8:clients served, a rural legal specialist in South Texas says.
Valley_Needing_Legal_Services.txt:9:David Hall, director of Texas Rural Legal Aid in Weslaco, said
Valley_Needing_Legal_Services.txt:10:legal services for the poor in the Rio Grande Valley are inadequate
Valley_Needing_Legal_Services.txt:11:and need a dramatic increase in funding.
Valley_Needing_Legal_Services.txt:12:"We've got one lawyer for every 30,000 poor people in the
Valley_Needing_Legal_Services.txt:13:Valley," Hall said in Sunday's editions of The Monitor
Valley_Needing_Legal_Services.txt:14:(McAllen).
Valley_Needing_Legal_Services.txt:15:As part of a nationwide overhaul of Legal Services Corp. to get
Valley_Needing_Legal_Services.txt:16:more poor people legal help, nine legal aid groups in Texas are
Valley_Needing_Legal_Services.txt:17:being folded into three, creating mega-programs involving dozens of
Valley_Needing_Legal_Services.txt:18:counties across thousands of miles.
Valley_Needing_Legal_Services.txt:19:John McKay, president of the organization, said the refocused
Valley_Needing_Legal_Services.txt:20:and larger programs can raise more money, find more lawyers and
Valley_Needing_Legal_Services.txt:21:increase the number of poor people who get help through the civil
Valley_Needing_Legal_Services.txt:22:courts system.
Valley_Needing_Legal_Services.txt:23:The programs, supplemented by funding from state governments,
Valley_Needing_Legal_Services.txt:24:bar associations and foundations, provide free legal help to the
Valley_Needing_Legal_Services.txt:25:poor but not in criminal cases.
Valley_Needing_Legal_Services.txt:26:But Hall said what's needed is more money. He said his group
Valley_Needing_Legal_Services.txt:27:takes on about 10,000 cases per year with a staff of eight or nine
Valley_Needing_Legal_Services.txt:28:attorneys.
Valley_Needing_Legal_Services.txt:29:Of the $329 million appropriated by Congress to Legal Services
Valley_Needing_Legal_Services.txt:30:Corp. this year, the Valley receives about $15 million to $20
Valley_Needing_Legal_Services.txt:31:million and employs about 37 staff lawyers. Organizations that
Valley_Needing_Legal_Services.txt:32:provide free or "pro bono" services are able to maintain a better
Valley_Needing_Legal_Services.txt:33:lawyer-to-client ratio because they often specialize in particular
Valley_Needing_Legal_Services.txt:34:kinds of cases, Hall said. Even accounting for pro bono work, as
Valley_Needing_Legal_Services.txt:35:much as 90 percent of the legal needs of the poor go unmet,
Valley_Needing_Legal_Services.txt:36:according to Bill Underwood, a law professor at Baylor
Valley_Needing_Legal_Services.txt:37:University.
Valley_Needing_Legal_Services.txt:38:"If every lawyer in the state of Texas was doing pro bono work,
Valley_Needing_Legal_Services.txt:39:then that still wouldn't be enough," he said.
Valley_Needing_Legal_Services.txt:40:Underwood said one lawyer working full-time for a legal services
Valley_Needing_Legal_Services.txt:41:group can accomplish as much as 20 lawyers doing part-time pro bono
Valley_Needing_Legal_Services.txt:42:work on a similar case.
Valley_Needing_Legal_Services.txt:43:"The problem is, there's never been adequate public funding," he
Valley_Needing_Legal_Services.txt:44:said.
Valley_Needing_Legal_Services.txt:45:But Ken Boehm, a former counsel to the LSC board said a lack of
Valley_Needing_Legal_Services.txt:46:funding for the federal LSC program is not the problem, it needs

12:Nothing in Bruce Zucker's upbringing seems to have prepared him
15:button-down shirts, Zucker grew up in an upper-middle-class enclave
16:in the west San Fernando Valley, far from the poverty he now sees
17:every day.
18:At Taft High School and UCLA, Zucker said, the closest brush
19:with poverty was reading newspaper articles about unscrupulous
21:Before graduating from Loyola Law School in 1993, Zucker
22:interviewed with a prestigious Santa Monica law firm and deftly
23:matched wits with the partners over lunch at an upscale restaurant.
24:Yet as he chatted amiably with the partners, something wasn't quite
25:right.
26:"I just didn't get the impression that they were really happy,"
27:Zucker said. "They seemed to be more passionate about their weekend
28:plans than the work they were doing."

36:"There was no big, dramatic event in my childhood that made me

59:Zucker, who volunteers at the center several days a week, was
60:recently honored for volunteering more than 150 hours in free legal
61:services to the poor -- more than three times the time donated by
62:most practicing attorneys, he said.
63:The State Bar of California presented Zucker with its 2002
66:statewide recognition to attorneys for providing pro bono legal
67:services to the poor.
